# fire-pixel-annotation

We provide some forest data and Matlab codes for the user-computer interactive annotation.

The main image annotation file was named "InteractiveAnnotation.m"

We also provide demos for the original image and their annotated image and videos, for example, named fire1.jpg and Refire1.jpg, respectively.

More details please see our manuscript, and if possible, please cite it in your work.

If you also have other questions, please contact us with the Email at xbyang@njfu.edu.cn.
